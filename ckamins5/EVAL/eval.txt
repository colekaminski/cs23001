m1: 90 (regrade)
m2: 90 - add.cpp reading in numbers wrong, sums fine;
m3: 0 - no m3 implementations; no multiply.cpp; no test cases added for times10 and digit;

bonus: 


P2

m1: 0 - empty string.cpp; no test files and own test cases with them -> should aim for at least 10 each, except constructors -> like empty strings, special characters, larger strings especially at or near cap, etc;
