P1

m1: 90 (regrade)

m3: 90 (regrade) - segmentation fault at end of multiply.cpp;

bonus: 100


P2

m1: 0 - empty string.cpp; no test files and own test cases with them -> should aim for at least 10 each, except constructors -> like empty strings, special characters, larger strings especially at or near cap, etc;
m2: 0 - please format your code in a consistent way; still only m1 implementations; commit test oracles;
